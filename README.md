Texas Hold'em Poker Bot (Samus)

Written in C# it will be capable of beating the four generic noob poker players,
such as 
"The Fish" (will pay to catch a card),
"The Station" (Calls with any hand),
"The Nit" (only plays the top 5% of hands),
"The Maniac" (liable to do anything),
"Random" (<--- duh)

Original idea was to play heads up hands with a stack of 10,000, (stacks regenerate to 10,000 after every hand).
