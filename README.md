4th year project

Texas Hold'em Poker Bot (Samus)

Written in C# it will be capable of beating the three generic noob poker players,
"The Fish" (will pay to catch a card),
"The Random Bot" (will make decisions erratically)
"The Maniac" (liable to do anything, very aggressive),

In its current state it is playing 6 handed play.
Since its completion has beaten two man made bots


Is playable inside a casino in the location -> https://github.com/beaverbusy/pokercasino
